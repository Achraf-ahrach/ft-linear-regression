# ft-linear-regression
This project introduces the fundamental concepts of machine learning by implementing a simple linear regression model from scratch. No advanced ML libraries are usedâ€”just math, code, and clear logic. The goal is to train a model to predict car prices from mileage using gradient descent optimization.
